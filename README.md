# Prompt Engineering Assistant

This repository contains explorations and implementations for a platform designed to help users craft more effective prompts for Large Language Models.

## Overview

A Grammarly-style editor that analyzes prompts in real-time to improve communication with AI models. Promptly identifies potential misalignments between human intent and LLM interpretation, highlighting ambiguous instructions, underspecified parameters, capability assumptions, conflicting directives, and potential response drift (overextension from the primary task). The tool provides suggested rewrites to help users craft clearer, more effective prompts that get the results they want from state-of-the-art models.

## To Explore...

#### Interactive Prompt Analysis System
- **In-line Feedback Mechanism**: Analyze initial prompts and provide yes/no or additional info requests to confirm or clarify specific points
- **Cognitive Mirror**: Reflect back explicit and implicit assumptions to users, making them aware of what their prompt actually conveys
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Flag potential confusion points that could lead to unexpected LLM responses
- **Weakness Identification**: Highlight areas where the prompt may be incomplete or unclear

#### Edge Case Management
- **Auto-completed Edge Case Suggestions**: Generate possible edge cases based on prompt analysis
- **Prompt Stress Testing**: Systematically test prompts against challenging inputs to find weaknesses
- **Exception Handling Suggestions**: Recommend ways to handle unexpected inputs or outputs

#### Version Control & Iteration
- **Prompt Version Tracking**: Track different versions of prompts and their outputs
- **Comparison Visualization**: Highlight differences between prompt iterations and resulting outputs
- **Performance Analytics**: Measure effectiveness of different prompt versions

#### Knowledge Boundary Estimator
- Identify when domain-specific knowledge in prompts exceeds what an LLM likely understands
- Focus on truly niche concepts rather than common domain knowledge
- Suggest additional context only when necessary

#### Instruction Decomposition Analyzer
- Break down complex instructions into atomic tasks
- Identify potential conflicts, redundancies, or gaps between components
- Suggest more coherent instruction structure

#### Context Visualization
- Create visual representations of what information is explicitly provided vs. assumed
- Map relationships between different components of complex prompts
- Identify knowledge gaps the model might encounter

#### Prompt Persona Simulator
- Help users understand how different LLM "personas" might interpret their prompt
- Simulate differences between pretrained vs. RLHF models, older vs. newer models
- Provide insights into how model capabilities affect prompt interpretation

#### Meta-cognitive Prompting Assistant
- Interview users about their requirements
- Help users articulate their full intentions
- Guide users through a systematic process of prompt improvement

#### Task-Specific Template Evolution
- Develop templates that learn from successful prompts for similar tasks
- Identify instruction patterns that work well for specific tasks
- Adapt to changing model capabilities

#### Instruction Clarity Scoring
- Quantify prompt clarity based on specificity, ambiguity, and completeness
- Provide specific suggestions for improvement
- Benchmark against known effective prompts

#### Context Window Optimization
- Help users make efficient use of context windows
- Identify redundant information
- Suggest more compact ways to express instructions

## Research Foundation

This project builds on insights from LLM researchers and practitioners, including discussions from Anthropic's prompt engineering team about what makes prompts effective and where users typically struggle.
