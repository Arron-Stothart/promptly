# Prompt Engineering Assistant

This repository contains explorations and implementations for a platform designed to help users craft more effective prompts for Large Language Models.

## Overview

A Grammarly-style editor that analyzes prompts in real-time to improve communication with AI models. Promptly identifies potential misalignments between human intent and LLM interpretation, highlighting ambiguous instructions, underspecified parameters, capability assumptions, conflicting directives, and potential response drift (overextension from the primary task). The tool provides suggested rewrites to help users craft clearer, more effective prompts that get the results they want from state-of-the-art models.

## Prompt Engineering Research

### Misalignments types (wip):

#### **Assumed Knowledge**
Text assuming model understands specific context (i.e. outside of SOTA knowledge) without explanation, leading to misinterpretation.
* Define New Concepts Clearly (The Philosophy Approach)
* Let the Model Interview You to Extract Information
* Provide Context About Yourself for More Relevant Help
* Explicitly state domain-specific terminology and acronyms
* Include relevant background information before presenting the specific request
* Ask the model to acknowledge knowledge gaps rather than speculate

#### **Ambiguous Directions**
Instructions open to multiple valid interpretations, forcing guesswork on your intent.
* Use Illustrative Examples Without Being Restrictive
* Be Clear and Detailed (The Temp Agency Worker Approach)
* Be Honest About Your Task Instead of Using Misleading Metaphors
* Specify the exact format for the response
* Provide evaluation criteria for what makes a good response
* Ask the model to acknowledge ambiguities it detects in your instructions


#### **Contradictory Instructions**
Conflicting directives.
* Prioritize instructions explicitly ("First do X, then if possible do Y")
* Ask the Model to Help Improve Your Prompt before execution
* Structure your request with clear hierarchies of importance
* Provide decision rules for handling conflicts ("When X and Y conflict, prioritize X")
* Review your prompt for logical consistency before submission
* Use numbered lists for sequential tasks rather than paragraph form

#### **Task Drift**
Overly broad or unconstrained requests that can cause the model to extrapolate beyond the prompters intent for the task.
* Provide Instructions for Edge Cases and Failure Modes
* Structured Reasoning with Step-by-Step Instructions
* Explicitly state boundaries of the task ("Focus only on X aspect")
* Include stopping criteria ("Analyze only these 3 factors")
* Break complex tasks into smaller, well-defined subtasks
* Specify what NOT to include in the response
* Create a clear scope statement at the beginning of your prompt
